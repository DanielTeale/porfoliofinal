# DT Web Developer

This is a portfolio website for myself which I'll be updating periodically. The idea is to make a functional webpage that showcases my skills 

## Features

#### Responsive design
The site operates effectively on popularly sized devices. On smaller screens the menu turns into an animated hamburger menu. THis was achieved with SCSS and HTML.

#### Single site design
It was designed to be a single page, all on-site links scroll to other sections on the same page. A small smount of Javascript is utilized for slow scrolling

#### Animated cards
All cards are animated to look like they are rising towards the viewer when hovered.

#### Fixed Background Attachment
All large images have fixed attachment

## Site Map
