This is a portfolio website for myself which I'll be updating periodically. The idea is to make a functional webpage that showcases my skills 

## Features

#### Responsive design
The site operates effectively on popularly sized devices. On smaller screens the menu turns into an animated hamburger menu. THis was achieved with SCSS and HTML.

#### Single site design
It was designed to be a single page, all on-site links scroll to other sections on the same page. A small smount of Javascript is utilized for slow scrolling

#### Animated cards
All cards are animated to look like they are rising towards the viewer when hovered.

#### Fixed Background Attachment
All large images have fixed attachment

## Site Map

* About - Title page
* Skills - cards with previous experience
* Portfolio - Image with github portfolio links
* Blog - embedded post from Medium
* Contact Me - Picture of myself, blurb and social media links

## Target Audience

This site is targetted towards future potential employers or clients

## Short Answer Q/A
### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today
With the invention of MS-DOS the early 80s saw a proliferation of networks and network users, such that it soon became necessary for more efficient methods to distinguish any network from another, leading to the invention of domains.THe early 90s saw the invention of Hypertext which lay the groundworks for the internet as we know it today. This was then followed by CSS which allowed for great flexibility in design and reusability of style code. In the mid 90s computer ownership and internet access exploded dramatically and it became a world wide phenomena. In the mid 2000s websites like Facebook and Twitter became mainstream, ushering a new age of the internet dubbed 'Web 2.0'. The invention of the smartphone meant more accessibility for users, but also required a shift in web page development to accommodate for all different devices. This lead to the invention of various responsive styling tools such as CSS flexbox media queries and CSS grid. 
### Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, webservers, DNS and web browsers
The web browser is the client-side handler for the web which concerns itself mainly with the display of information from the web. A user types in the website they want, usually via the sites domain name. It then sends the signal to a DNS server, usually hosted by their Internet Service Provider, but also big companies such as Google, which store the domains and their respective IP addresses. I then matches the domain with the IP address of the web server. The web server 'hosts' the website and holds most of the information the site requires to function. A domain may have multiple web servers with identical information depending on the traffic the site receives and how global its user base is. The web server then returns the required information back to the user, usually this is the HTML and CSS styling but can include all sorts of information depending on the purpose of the website.
### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today
The development of Social Media has had a major impact on the world today. It has helped bring together people from all over the world and given a voice to many that were unheard. Social Media has helped spread freedom and free speech and had a major impact on politics, for example it was instrumental in the Arab Spring protests in the middle east, helping the people organise and disseminate information. Leaders of countries now use social media to communicate with their constituents. It can also be argued to have a negative impact on communities, people now spend less time communicating in person with each other, excessive social media usage is said to contribute to depression and arguably has contributed to a mental health crisis. It has also had a major impact on advertising and business, with any serious business requiring some kind of social media presence to advertise their products. It has also contributed to the scientific community, allowing for social experiments to be conducted on mass and human behaviour to be analysed for both positive and negative purposes.
